This week [Pavitra](https://www.imsc.res.in/pavitra_s) will be presenting a review article that addresses the following questions. How many genes are subtly mutated in a typical human cancer? How many of those mutations are important for the cancer to progress? Does the timing of such mutations hold relevance?
## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Tuesday (September 17, 2019), 2:15 PM
