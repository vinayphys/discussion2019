# A Discussion Group of Graduate Students at IMSc

This page contains the details that come out of the discussions held almost every week on Friday at [IMSc Chennai](https://www.imsc.res.in/). A group of graduate students, primarily from Physics and Computational Biology, participate in the discussion.

## Discussion Topics:

Some of the speakers listed below have volunteered to lead a set of discussions on the topic of their choice:

Chandrani	:	Chromatin remodelling during cell fate decision  
Devanand	:	“Water-free” computer model for fluid bilayer membranes  
Pavitra		:	Genome Instabilities  
Sreevidya	:	Intinsic disordered proteins - an enigma!  
Vinay		  :	Glassy dynamics in embryonic tissues  

If you also want to be the part of the discussion group then please mail us with the details.
