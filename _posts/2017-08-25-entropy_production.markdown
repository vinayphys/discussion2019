[Rajesh](https://rajeshrinet.github.io/) will also be giving this week's talk. He will give a quick summary of his last talk and then go through the following paper by Udo Seifert in detail:  

Seifert, Udo. ["Entropy production along a stochastic trajectory and an integral fluctuation theorem."](https://journals.aps.org/prl/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevLett.95.040602) Physical review letters 95.4 (2005): 040602.

## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Saturday (August 26, 2017), 2 PM  
**Venue:** 326/327  

## [Here](https://www.imsc.res.in/~vinayv/discussion/stochasticThermodynamics.pdf) is the slides from the discussion last week.
