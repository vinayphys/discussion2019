[Vinay](https://www.imsc.res.in/~vinayv/) will initiate the first discussion of this season. He will be talking about an aspect of developmental biology where researchers have shown a similarity between micromechanical movements of embryonic cells and glassy dynamics. The tools from glassy physics can help in understanding the behavioral change of a group of cells from fluid-like to solid-like. Such a study is expected to reveal the intricacies of organs gaining their shape during embryonic development. 

## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Friday (June 21, 2019), 2:15 PM  
**Venue:** 326/327
