This week [Chandrani](https://www.imsc.res.in/chandrani_kumari) will talk about classification alogorithms in machine learning and how we can use these algorithms for the identification of fluid and gel domains close to the main transition of dipalmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) bilayers

## Time and venue for the Discussion:
**Time:** Tuesday (October 1, 2019), 2:15 PM  
**Venue:** 123/117
