This week [Chandrashekar](https://www.imsc.res.in/chandrashekar_k) will talk about stochastic resonance (SR). It is a phenomenon where a signal which is typically too weak to be detected by a sensor can be detected on addition of white noise. Unlike the usual bad reputation noise has with respect to making measurements here in this phenomenon the noise plays a positive role. He will demonstrate it using a simple example of ball stuck in a double well potential subjected to a periodic signal.   

SR has been demonstrated in numerous systems and most probably in his next talk (after this current one) he will demonstrate the phenomenon in the context of a biological problem. This will be a brief informal introduction to the phenomenon. He will be presenting mostly using a jupyter notebook.
