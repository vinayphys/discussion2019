[Sreevidya](https://www.imsc.res.in/sreevidya_t_s) will talk about Intrinsically disordered proteins ; a group  
of proteins which do not follow the classical structure-function paradigm. Disorder in protein structures can be either local or  
global. Locally disordered regions are common and have been observed  
in numerous X-ray and NMR structures of proteins; in some cases, such  
disordered regions have been linked to biological function. In this  
discussion, a brief historical overview of IDPs will be seen along  
with a few of their characteristic features and functional importance

## Time and venue for the Discussion:
